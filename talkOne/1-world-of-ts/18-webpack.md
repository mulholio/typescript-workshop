# Webpack

- Features
  - Manages your asset pipeline (not just code!), both by itself and by orchestrating other build tools e.g. Babel
  - Makes your app performant: code-splitting, minification
  - Gives you great DX: hot-module reloading, nice plugins
- Usually, you don't have to worry about this as it gets extrracted away by many projects (e.g. Next.js, Create React App)
