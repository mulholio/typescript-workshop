# What is TS?

- `isJS -> isTS` (but `!isJs -> isTs`)
- Every (good) thing you can do in JS, you can do in TS
- Compiles to JS like Elm, Reason, ClojureScript, PureScript, \[hip new -script here\] but is more similar to JS than all of these
- Is a whole new language, not just some comments which help you (e.g. like Flow)
